This website is information for content creators, instructors, and TAs.

This website is associated with a github repo, where things such as datasets, pdfs (and code for) lectures, and other resources are held.

The github repo also has an issue tracker. Please use it as you like.

The students use the course via [OpenEdX\@UZH](https://openedx.mnf.uzh.ch/courses/course-v1:UZH+BIO144+FS2017/info). They don't need to look at this website, and we don't make them aware of it. It is public however, so please do not add any sensitive information, such as personal information about students, or any information related to examination questions and answers.
